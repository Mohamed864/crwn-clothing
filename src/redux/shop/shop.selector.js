export const selectCollections = createSelector([selectShop], (shop) => {
  return shop.collections;
});

export const selectCollectionsForPreview = createSelector(
  [selectCollections],
  (collections) => {
    return collections
      ? Object.keys(collections).map((key) => collections[key])
      : [];
  }
);

//data normalization so i needd to change the array to object

export const selectCollection = (collectionUrlParam) =>
  createSelector(
    [selectCollections],
    (collections) => collections[collectionUrlParam]
  );
